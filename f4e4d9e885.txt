CLUE 4:
Doctor who : Life is a circle, endlessly turning, a loop where endings fold back into beginnings. To find what you seek, you must journey back to where it all began, retracing the steps through timeâ€™s winding paths. From my travels beyond time itself, I carry a code, a key hidden within the patterns of the past and future. Solve it, and the answer to your plight will be revealed.

Hint : Within curves that never end, a secret lies in base embraced by endless bends.
Seek the loop turned sideways to find the code where time transcends.

"But remember, time works in mysterious ways, and things are not always as they seem. What appears clear may yet be twisted, shadows shift, and meanings dance out of order.(with noises in between) To unveil the truth, the message you decode must be seen anew. Only then will the path forward truly reveal itself."
