But in the midst of this fall, there is a new hope shining in a system far, far away, from a planet “similar” to ours. A wormhole has been opened near Saturn.\n\nYears ago a message was sent to the stars into the abyss without any hope of reply, fortunately it was replied, from a species far superior to us in intelligence. In these dire times our only option was to ask for help and our plea has been answered. An invitation to a different planet in a different star. You are chosen to seek solutions for mankind. To a world where humanity can rise again.\n\nAnd so… your Hunterstellar journey begins through the wormhole, with a little hope and many trials ahead.",
