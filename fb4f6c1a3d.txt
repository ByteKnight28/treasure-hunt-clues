CLUE 2: 
“You have surpassed the first trial, leaving the world behind. Now you stand within the shadowed realm of Hades, where souls dwell in eternal twilight. Few have entered, fewer returned. Tread carefully, for you have crossed into the heart of the underworld.”

Hades : Mortals, you now tread the edge of shadow and silence, where life and death are but whispers. To alter the fate of your world, you must unlock truths older than time. Speak wisely, for only those who embrace the darkness may glimpse the dawn.

“I dwell beneath the sky’s wide veil,
Where stories drift on whispered gale.
No walls confine my fleeting breath,
Yet music blooms beyond life and death.

Find the light that’s never bound,
Where echoes dance without a sound.
From ash and dust, new hope takes flight, a silent glow in the darkest night.”

Now to proceed, you have to guess the name of this hope
